Music Instrument Controller
===========================

Created a Musical Controller that would be able to play a LEGO made guitar and cymbal using the keyboard. The cymbal has a setting for automatic playing (with 3 different tempos to choose form) and manual with the press of a key. The guitar is also strummed with the press of a key and the guitar string can be tightened or loosened (6 different pitche options).
